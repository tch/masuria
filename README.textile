h3. Description

Masuria is a system for distributed relational data processing. It has the following characteristics: 

* simple programming model;
* extensible APIs, suitable for adaptation to already existing storage technologies;
* modular and pluggable implementation based on OSGi technology.


h3. Sample Code

The following is a job definition that computes Single Source Shortest Paths from the starting vertex in a graph to all other vertices in that graph. The algorithm is taken from the Google Pregel paper[3].


bc.. public class SSSPJob extends JobBase<Neo4JElement, DistanceMessage>
                         implements IJob<Neo4JElement, DistanceMessage> {

  public SSSPJob(final IElementId id, final IProgram program,
                 final JobExecutionContext executionContext) {

    super(id, program, executionContext);
  }

  @Override
  public void superStep() {

    int minDist = this.isStartingElement() ? 0 : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
    IVertex v = this.getElement();
    
    for(DistanceMessage msg: messages()) { // Choose min. proposed distance 

      minDist = Math.min(minDist, msg.getDistance() );

    }
        
    if( minDist < this.getCurrentDistance() ) { //If improves the path, store and propagate
      
      this.setCurrentDistance(minDist);
      
      for(IEdge r: v.getOutgoingEdges(DemoRelationshipTypes.KNOWS) )  {
        
        IElement recipient = r.getOtherElement(v);
        
        int rDist = this.getLengthOf(r);
        
        this.sendMessage( new DistanceMessage(minDist+rDist, recipient.getId(), this.getId()) );
        
      }
      
    }
    
  }



h3. Getting Started

 While the targeted execution environment for the framework is an OSGi container, simple examples can be run locally via executable class _MasuriaDemoDriver_[5].


h3. Development status

 This is a prototype created mainly to identify main components and develop adequate intuitions. It is evolving into 0.0.1 milestone.
 
h4. TODO
  
 * OSGIfying build and components
 ** provide master and peer applications
 ** bundle-based program/job management
 ** osgi-enabled configuration management/logging
 * capability to run in a distributed environment 
 * add aggregator/reduce mechanism
 * add combiner framework


h3. Related Work

* Apache Hama[2]
 
* Google Pregel[3]
 
* CMU GraphLab[4]
 
 and number of other research projects.
